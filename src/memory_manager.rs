/// A trait for user-defined memory management in MCJIT.
///
/// Implementors can override how LLVM's MCJIT engine allocates memory for code
/// and data sections. This is sometimes needed for:
/// - custom allocators,
/// - sandboxed or restricted environments,
/// - capturing stack map sections (e.g., for garbage collection),
/// - or other specialized JIT memory management requirements.
///
/// # StackMap and GC Integration
///
/// By examining the `section_name` argument in [`allocate_data_section`], you
/// can detect sections such as `.llvm_stackmaps` (on ELF) or `__llvm_stackmaps`
/// (on Mach-O). Recording the location of these sections may be useful for
/// custom garbage collectors. For more information, refer to the [LLVM
/// StackMaps documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/StackMaps.html#stack-map-section).
///
/// Typically, on Darwin (Mach-O), the stack map section name is `__llvm_stackmaps`,
/// and on Linux (ELF), it is `.llvm_stackmaps`.
